### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I am Zhicheng. 

I'm currently working as a quant dev in a crypto hedge fund, learning to implement low latency trading systems, data services and arbitraging strategies. <br>

Python and C++ are my languages. <br>

I record my hand-on experiences and paper digest in the following Quant_Notes repo.

Here's my other [github account](https://github.com/ZhichengTang1).
